		<h1>Demonstration of Muon decay upon contact with a steel target</h1>

		    The video below is a visualisation of how a cosmic ray muon decays when colliding with a steel target in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field. The muon's spin vector is represented by a white arrow passing through it during the precession. The decay product that produces a measurement in our experiment is the positron, which is deflected from the steel target up towards the scintillator plate of the cosmic ray detector in order to produce an electrical signal.
		    
		    It should be noted that there are other decay products coming from the muon (electron and muon neutrinos) that have been omitted in this demonstration.
